### Rebelworks Newsletter Website

#### What is Rebelworks newsletter

Rebelworks weekly newsletter is a magazine or newsletter for internal team members of Rebelworks (we call them rebellion / rebels). The content can be an article, audio, video about useful information, or tips for team members (rebellion).

#### Motivation
The newsletter is sent regularly on a  weekly basis via email, but I prefer to read articles on the web instead of the inbox mail. So I decided to create a simple blog for an alternative of the email-based newsletter. It is build with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and uses [contentful headless CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) as a source of content.

#### Contributing
Any kind of contributions are appreciated
